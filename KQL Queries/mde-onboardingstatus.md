## KQL Query

```kusto
DeviceInfo
| summarize LastSeen = arg_max(Timestamp, *) by DeviceName
| where OnboardingStatus != "Onboarded"
| where OSPlatform startswith "Windows"
| where LastSeen > ago(30d)  // seen in the last 30 days
| project DeviceName, OSPlatform, OnboardingStatus, LastSeen
| order by LastSeen desc
